# Utility Setup Scripts

These scripts are intended to speed up setup on remote Linux instances. In particular, this set of scripts was developed for Amazon EC2 instances with Ubuntu 16 AMIs.

Keep in mind that all scripts will need to be run by a user with `sudo` privileges.

**Scripts:**

* `install-node-dependencies.sh` install items needed to run node
* `install-db-dependencies.sh` install items needed for the database
